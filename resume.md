## Profile

<p class="highlight-text">Electrical engineer and research coordinator with experience in hardware design for high-speed digital communication,
photonic systems, and academic research processes for geophysical science applications.</p>

My background includes avionics sensor design at Amazon, signal integrity engineering at Microsoft, and academic research
coordination for geophysics and environmental sensing groups at the University of Washington. I am interested in experimental
design workflows, precision measurement systems, and field operations for high-quality scientific data collection. 
<p class="highlight-text">I am seeking roles in applied research and instrumentation alongside future graduate study at the intersection of hardware
engineering, experimental physics, and geophysical sciences.</p>
