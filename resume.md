## Profile

Electrical engineer and research coordinator with experience in hardware design for high-speed digital communication,
photonic systems, and academic research processes for geophysical science applications.

My background includes avionics sensor design at Amazon, signal integrity engineering at Microsoft, and academic research
coordination for geophysics and environmental sensing groups at the University of Washington. I am interested in experimental
design workflows, precision measurement systems, and field operations for high-quality scientific data collection.
I am seeking roles in applied research and instrumentation alongside future graduate study at the intersection of hardware
engineering, experimental physics, and geophysical sciences.
